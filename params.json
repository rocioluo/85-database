Showing the impact of western culture following China's opening and reform (Gao ,2008), numerous unofficial art groups appeared spontaneously from 1984 to 1986, leading 85 art new wave to this exuberant period in the history (Wu, 2010). As the participator and artist, Professor Gao experienced that movement, and fortunately, he holds a lot of first-hand information including artists' letters, conference letter, and photos of exhibitions. Most of them are organized in his book the 85 movement, an anthology of historical sources. I appreciate a lot that he admits me to use his work as row data to do my research.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Structure of the picture order (index of pictures)\r\n\r\nType of pictures & Structure of the picture note\r\n\r\n1) Document\r\nexample picture name: Xu Zhou modern art exhibition, Xu Zhou, 1986\r\nstructure: Document name, Place(some do not have, but can logically get from context), Time\r\n\r\n2) Action\r\nexample picture name: Protest of the Stars Group,1979,Beijing(Wang Keping is holding the logo)\r\nstructure: Action name, Time, Description\r\n\r\n3) Work\r\nexample picture name: Wang Keping, Silence, wood sculpture,1979\r\nstructure: Artist, Work name, Material, Time\r\n\r\n### Data structure based on pictures' structure\r\nThere are 5 types of data which are stored into Neo4j\r\n\r\n1) Document\r\nattribute: \r\ndocument_id,type(document),document_place,document_topic(document name&description),picture_name\r\n\r\n2) Action\r\nattribute:\r\naction_id,typeï¼ˆscenario, protest, photo),action_place,year,picture_name\r\n\r\n3) Work\r\nattribute:\r\nwork_id,type(work),work_name,work_material,year,artist_name,picture_name\r\n\r\n4) Artist\r\nattribute:\r\nartist_name,artist_id\r\n\r\n5) Exhibition\r\nattribute:\r\nexhibition_name,exhibition_id\r\n\r\n### The relation between attributes of pictures\r\n\r\n\r\n### Searching\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
